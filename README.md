# TriValleyHacks2023

Speech-i-Py is a speech-to-code web application that uses speech recognition to convert spoken words to Python programming. With vocal recognition and proper Python syntax, it revolutionizes who has the world of coding at their fingertips -- even those who literally can't use their fingertips. We strive to provide the millions of people with challenges typing and coding with a simple but effective solution.

Our final file submissions for TriValley Hacks are voiceDraft.py for vocal recognition code and recog_final.py and recog-test-version2.py (which is more detailed) for spoken text to Python code, including examples. Please ignore all other files.

Unfortunately, we could not achive our highest potential due to WiFi issues. We hope to continue working on integrating the different facets of our project in better conditions.

We hope you enjoy!
